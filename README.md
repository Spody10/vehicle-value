# vehicle-value
  
 ## Description 
    
 This URL is designed to offer a user free information regarding a vehicle by using a vin decoder. The user is greated on the homepage by a simple to use tool to insert a vin number. 

 Once the vin is inserted, an API is fetched from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the information is displayed in a card on the second page. 

 Sure, there are lots of sites out there capable of retrieving this information. But you normally have to pay to receive it, or worse, you're bombarded with targeted ads once the search concludes. The concept came from the idea of simply satisfying the users curiousity without all the games that come with it.

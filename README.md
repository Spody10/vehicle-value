<!-- # Vehicle-Value

This URL is designed to offer a user free information regarding a vehicle by using a vin decoder. The user is greated on the homepage by a simple to use tool to insert a vin number. 

Once the vin is inserted, an API is fetched from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the information is displayed in a card on the second page. 

Sure, there are lots of sites out there capable of retrieving this information. But you normally have to pay to receive it, or worse, you're bombarded with targeted ads once the search concludes. The concept came from the idea of simply satisfying the users curiousity without all the games that come with it. 

LANGUAGES USED

The site was built using basic HTML with Materialize CSS Framework. We added Javascript to allow the user to interact with the site and fetch the APIs. 

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

The next phase of this site will include adding an API to display stock images based on the vin number as well as giving the user an evaluation of that particular vehicle given the current miles. 

We would also like to add additional pages that include FAQs, About Us and a Profile page. We left placeholders in there now to build on in the future.

CHALLENGES

Our biggest challenge was finding free sources of information. We started with the idea of providing a vehicle photo along with the information. But this was too lofty of a goal as most sources wanted to be paid to give this information. 

Another challenge was getting used to multiple people pushing and pulling from one GitHub repo. The modules set us up with good practices with adding new feature braches, but merging those to the develop and main branch was something new as we had to compare code and correct issues. 

RESOURCES

This page was built using the NHTSA API. The API was used to generate all the information displayed in the vehicle card.
